# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
# Data Visualization Practical Worksheet  
*Implementing Charting Libraries to Display Data for Analytics*  

## Overview  
In this practical worksheet, you'll implement various charting libraries to create an analytics dashboard using React. By the end of this exercise, you'll understand how to:  
1. Set up and use different charting libraries in a React application  
2. Create various chart types for data analysis  
3. Make charts responsive and interactive  
4. Load and transform data for visualization  
5. Optimize charts for performance  

## Part 1: Creating Chart Components  
Create the chart components one by one.  

### 1. Monthly Sales Chart (Line Chart with Recharts)  
Create a file components/MonthlySalesChart.jsx.  

### 2. Product Category Chart (Pie Chart with Recharts)  
Create a file components/ProductCategoryChart.jsx.  

### 3. Customer Acquisition Chart (Bar Chart with react-chartjs-2)  
Create a file components/CustomerAcquisitionChart.jsx.  

### 4. Weekly Visitors Chart (Area Chart with react-chartjs-2)  
Create a file components/WeeklyVisitorsChart.jsx.
